# Xhosa Translations
![Alt text](http://www.capetown.at/letters/Images/xhosa%20woman.JPG)

This is a collection of portable object files for various files.
Most (if not all) the software that is being and will be translated is open source.
I am not a linguist (or anything remotely close to being an expert at languages) so my translations are not guaranteed to be perfect.

## Why?
Ndidikiwe kukusebenzisa isiNgesi entweni yonke that's why!
## Contributing
